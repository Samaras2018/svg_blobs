blob image masking effect with svg. simple physics pull the blobs towards the center of the image, keeping them in motion.

look in `main.js` for config options (at the top).

there are two mouseover options (see the `onHover` constant in `main.js`):

- `follow`: when hovering over an image, blobs are drawn towards the mouse position
- `reveal`: the blobs expand to reveal the entire image
